# BabyCoach AI Assistant - Development Kickoff Guide

## Project Context & Background

You are developing **BabyCoach**, an AI-powered personal knowledge assistant that enables natural language querying of a user's personal Evernote corpus. This is a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that transforms years of personal notes into an conversational knowledge base.

## Current State & Dependencies

### Data Foundation Already Complete
- **Evernote corpus extraction**: 2,057 notes successfully parsed and cleaned
- **Data format**: Structured JSON (~8MB, human-readable IDs like `band_practice_checklist`)
- **Text cleaning**: 76-90% size reduction via ENML processing (optimized for embeddings)
- **Export location**: `~/Desktop/evernote_rag_export_*.json` (security: excluded from git)
- **Source project**: `enote_api` repo with production-ready export functionality

### Integration Ready Data Format
```python
# The corpus is already in perfect RAG format:
{
    "id": "band_practice_checklist",
    "text": "Musician AOF\n\nTASCAM\n2AA Batteries...",  # Clean, embedding-ready
    "metadata": {
        "title": "Band Practice checklist",
        "tags": ["music", "band"],
        "created": "2021-02-12",
        "source": "evernote"
    }
}
```

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### RAG Implementation Strategy
- **Vector Store**: Choose between Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone (local vs hosted decision)
- **Embeddings**: text-embedding-3-small or similar (~1000 dims, proven effective)
- **Chunking Strategy**: TBD - experiment with note-level vs paragraph-level chunks
- **Retrieval**: Semantic search + metadata filtering (tags, dates, titles)

### Deployment Path Exploration (Priority Order)
1. **Local Development First**: Mac-based prototyping with local models/vector stores
2. **Hosted Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic API integration for production quality
3. **Cloud Deployment**: If local performance insufficient
4. **Free-tier Experimentation**: Colab/Lightning AI for resource-intensive tasks

### Interface Requirements
- **MVP**: Simple command-line or notebook interface for natural language queries
- **Future**: Web interface, chat-style interaction, conversation context
- **Input**: Natural language questions about personal notes
- **Output**: 1-3 paragraph responses synthesizing relevant note content

## Key Technical Challenges to Address

### RAG Pipeline Optimization
- **Chunk size vs context**: Balance retrieval granularity with response coherence
- **Metadata integration**: Leverage tags, dates, titles for better retrieval
- **Query expansion**: Handle synonyms, temporal queries, topic relationships
- **Response synthesis**: Combine multiple note sources into coherent answers

### Performance & Scalability
- **Memory efficiency**: 2,057 notes → likely ~10K+ chunks in vector store
- **Query latency**: Target <5 second response times for good UX
- **Context window management**: Fit retrieved chunks + conversation history
- **Incremental updates**: Plan for adding new notes without full reindexing

### User Experience Design
- **Query patterns**: Anticipate "What did I write about X?", "When did I...?", "Show me notes related to..."
- **Context preservation**: Multi-turn conversations, follow-up questions
- **Source attribution**: Show which notes contributed to each response
- **Confidence indicators**: Signal when responses are uncertain or incomplete

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Data source**: Access to exported JSON from enote_api project
- **Python environment**: Likely same as enote_api (3.13.5, venv setup)
- **Key libraries**: langchain/llamaindex, vector store client, embedding model access
- **Development tools**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, pytest for testing

### Initial Development Tasks
1. **Data ingestion**: Load and validate the exported corpus JSON
2. **Vector store setup**: Choose and configure local vector database
3. **Embedding pipeline**: Process notes into searchable vectors
4. **Basic retrieval**: Implement semantic search with metadata filtering
5. **Response generation**: Connect retrieval results to LLM for synthesis
6. **Interface prototype**: Command-line query interface for testing

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Technical Validation
- **Retrieval accuracy**: Do semantic searches return relevant notes?
- **Response quality**: Are synthesized answers helpful and accurate?
- **Performance**: Acceptable query response times
- **Coverage**: System handles diverse query types from real usage

### User Experience Validation
- **Natural interaction**: Queries feel conversational, not keyword-based
- **Comprehensive answers**: Responses draw from multiple relevant notes
- **Source transparency**: User can verify and explore contributing notes
- **Iterative refinement**: System improves with usage patterns

## Architecture Decisions to Document

### Vector Store Choice
- Local (Chroma, FAISS) vs hosted (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Persistence strategy, backup/restore capabilities
- Metadata indexing and filtering capabilities

### Embedding Strategy
- Model selection (OpenAI, Hugging Face, local models)
- Chunking approach (note-level, paragraph-level, semantic chunking)
- Metadata preservation in vector space

### LLM Integration
- Local models (Ollama, Llama) vs API services (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Context window management and retrieval result integration
- Conversation memory and multi-turn handling

### Development Workflow
- Notebook-driven experimentation vs production code structure
- Testing strategy for RAG pipeline components
- Evaluation datasets and benchmarks

## Key Resources & References

### Technical Foundation
- **Corpus data**: Pre-processed and optimized from enote_api
- **RAG frameworks**: LangChain, LlamaIndex documentation
- **Vector databases**: Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone quickstart guides
- **Embedding models**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, Sentence Transformers

### Domain Knowledge
- **Personal note patterns**: Understand user's note-taking style from corpus analysis
- **Query intent categories**: Research, reference lookup, timeline reconstruction
- **Response formats**: Direct answers, note summaries, relationship mapping

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Access control**: Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- **Backup strategy**: Protect vector stores and processed data

### Development Security
- **Environment isolation**: Use virtual environments for dependencies
- **Secret management**: Store API keys in environment variables
- **Git safety**: Exclude personal data and credentials from version control
- **Testing data**: Use synthetic or public data for development testing
